# Study Roulette: A Stable Randomizer for Study Recruitment Links

This project is intended for situations where multiple studies are simultaneously recruiting from the same recruitment link. So, a link like:

https://example.edu/sr?email=foo@bar.baz&ts=1769010749&cn=2772222584

might redirect to one of:

https://redcap.example.edu/surveys/?s=12345678&email=foo@bar.baz&ts=1769010749&cn=2772222584
https://redcap.example.edu/surveys/?s=abcdef12&email=foo@bar.baz&ts=1769010749&cn=2772222584

This process merges URL parameters, with configuration-provided parameters taking precedence.

This randomization is stable -- the same initial link will randomize to the same target, even if the available list of studies changes.

## Implementation

This project uses python and fastapi. It does not have a traditional database; it uses text files stored in the filesystem. This should be performant enough for up to a few hundred thousand unique redirect URLs.

Required settings:

* `LOOKUP_DIR` a path, must be readable/writable by this process, where we'll store the computed redirects
* `STUDIES_FILE` A path, must be readable by this process, that will list the potential study links in a weighted list

### Algorithm

* Get the URL parameters, compute a SHA256 hash from them -- I think json.dumps(params, sort_keys=True) will do this stably, store it in `url_hash`
* Set `destination_url` to None
* Look for `LOOKUP_DIR`/`url_hash`
* If it's found, read the file and store the contents in `destination_url`
* Otherwise, pick a random URL from `STUDIES_FILE`, merge the parameters and store the result in `destination_url`
* Store `destination_url` in `LOOKUP_DIR`/`url_hash`
* Return a 302 to `destination_url`

URLs will be parsed, parameter merged, and generated using python's `urllib` module.

### Routes

#### GET /

Runs the above algorithm, returns a 302 Found if this is found, 404 if there are no parameters, 500 if the algorithm fails for any reason

#### GET /health

Checks to make sure we can read and write to `LOOKUP_DIR` and that `STUDIES_FILE` is readable and well-formed. Always returns a JSON object with the keys `status`, `errors`, and `studies`.

If things are okay, returns 200 OK with:
- `status` = `"ok"`
- `errors` = `[]`
- `studies` = array of `{url, weight, percent, note?}` objects showing the parsed studies

If there are errors, returns 500 with:
- `status` = `"error"`
- `errors` = array of error strings
- `studies` = array of any studies that *did* parse correctly

The `studies` array is useful for verifying your TOML file is being parsed correctly. The `percent` field shows the normalized weight as a percentage, so you can easily see what fraction of new redirects will go to each study.

**Note:** If some studies fail to parse but others are valid, `/health` returns 500 (for monitoring purposes) but still lists the valid studies. The `/sr` endpoint will continue to redirect to valid studies even when there are parse errors, ensuring service continuity.

### `STUDIES_FILE`

This is a TOML file containing a `studies` array. Each study must have `url` and `weight` keys, and may optionally have a `note` key. Extra keys are ignored.

Example:

```toml
studies = [
    {url = "https://redcap.example.edu/surveys/?s=12345678", weight = 1, note = "Control group"},
    {url = "https://redcap.example.edu/surveys/?s=abcdef12", weight = 2, note = "Treatment group"},
]
```

Or using the expanded TOML array-of-tables syntax:

```toml
[[studies]]
url = "https://redcap.example.edu/surveys/?s=12345678"
weight = 1
note = "Control group"

[[studies]]
url = "https://redcap.example.edu/surveys/?s=abcdef12"
weight = 2
note = "Treatment group"
```

URLs must be valid (have a scheme and host) and parseable by `urllib.parse`.

Weights must be nonnegative numbers. Weights are relative -- all weights are divided by the total sum of the weights, so `[1, 0.5]` and `[100, 50]` will behave identically. A weight of 0 is valid and removes the URL from consideration in randomization. At least one weight must be positive.

### `LOOKUP_DIR`

Contains a set of files with names as lowercase sha256 hex digests. The contents of each file will be a single URL, optionally terminated with a newline. File contents should be trimmed of whitespace before redirecting to URLs. URL format will not be checked before redirecting.

**Important:** `LOOKUP_DIR` should be on a local filesystem that supports POSIX file locking (e.g., ext4, APFS). Network filesystems (NFS, SMB) may not provide reliable locking semantics and could lead to race conditions.

## Troubleshooting

Did a bad redirect wind up in LOOKUP_DIR? Find the file with the bad lookup (use something like `grep`) and edit or delete it.

## Developing

Before comitting changes, make sure `uv run pytest` and `uv run ty check` pass without errors.
